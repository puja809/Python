limitations:
1.Limited number of guesses are there that is 5
2.Once the guesses are over the Gave is also over
3. If the user guess the correct number, give him a shout-out and print the
number of guesses he took
4.Every time the user enters a number, display the number of guess left and whether the
number is greater or lesser than the original number
